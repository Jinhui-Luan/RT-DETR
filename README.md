# Implementation of RT-DeTR using PyTorch Framework

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Description

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the cutting-edge RT-DeTR (Realtime Detection Transformer). 

## Contents

The repository currently includes implementations of two RT-DeTR models:

1. RT-DeTR-L    [DONE]
2. RT-DeTR-X    [DONE]

## Note

This is a reference implementation of RT-DeTR model using PyTorch. At the time of creating this repository, RT-DeTR is officially available only through the PaddlePaddle framework.

Kindly use this as a starting point to implement a fully-functional RT-DeTR model, using PyTorch framework.
